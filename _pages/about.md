I am a biosemiotician specializing in animal studies, ecosemiotics, and complexity theory. I hold a Ph.D. in Semiotics from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it), where my dissertation explored the threshold between life and non-life through an ecosystemic lens, integrating perspectives from biosemiotics, evolutionary biology, systems theory, and artificial life sciences.

My current research focuses on how AI decodes and models animal communication, exploring the potential of computational creativity and semiotic modeling to bridge the gap between human and non-human sign systems.

I am a researcher in the project CULT-UP: Upcycling and Cultural Heritage, where I explore the impact of plastic waste on animal interpretation processes and ecological semiosis, a teacher of the course “Design della mente” at [Scuola Holden](https://scuolaholden.it) in Turin, and serve as an Associate Editor for Biosemiotics (Springer), Managing Editor for Linguistic Frontiers (Mouton), and Editor for Animal Studies. Rivista italiana di zooantropologia (Apeiron). My research investigates the communication of nature, ecological grammars, and the agency of inorganic materials, as well as broader topics such as mineral evolution, synthetic life, and xenobiology. 

During my visiting period at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee), I specialized in ecosemiotics applied to climate change, examining how semiotic networks shape environmental perception and adaptation.
