I hold a Ph.D. in Semiotics from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it), where my dissertation explored the threshold between life and non-life through an ecosystemic lens, integrating perspectives from biosemiotics, evolutionary biology, systems theory, and artificial life sciences.

My current research as a Fellow Researcher focuses on how AI decodes and models animal communication, exploring the potential of computational creativity and semiotic modeling to bridge the gap between human and non-human sign systems.
