### Research Areas  
Currently, I am a Research Fellow on the project “San Francesco e l’AI” at the Department of Philosophy and Education, University of Turin (PI: Prof. Massimo Leone, for the 2025/26 cycle), focusing on animal communication and artificial intelligence; I also collaborate on the PRIN–PNRR project “CULT-UP – Upcycling and Cultural Heritage” (2023–2025, total funding of €224,132), where I investigate how plastic waste affects animal interpretation processes and ecological communication.
