### Research Areas  
CULT-UP (University of Bologna) theorizes the efficacy of “cultural upcycling” by taking into account the semiotic value of recovered objects. Within this framework, I investigate how plastic waste affects animal interpretation processes and ecological communication.

San Francesco e l’AI (University of Turin) explores how artificial intelligence can interpret signals from animals and plants, integrating semiotics, ethics, and technology to promote new forms of coexistence between humans and other living beings.
